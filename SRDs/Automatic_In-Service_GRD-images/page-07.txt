[| GRD-474 - Getting issue detalls... | Sr ,zys | ] No impact to default template when Valid Signal Time Interval is updated on TRIB/Line
ISCG

The NE shall ensure that changing the ValidSignalTimeinterval on an individual TRIB-PTP or Line-PTP/SCG-PTP shall not cause the value in the
default template to be changed.

[| GRD-475 - Getting issue details... Gr,tyg | |] No pre-conditions for changing the Valid Signal Time Interval

The NE shall allow changing the ValidSignalTimeinterval value at any time using the default template method or on an individual TRIB-PTP or Line-PTP
/SCG-PTP irrespective of the state of the TRIB-PTP/Client CTP, Line-PTP/SCG-PTP/SCH CTP, or the value of RemValidSignalTimer. When such a
change is done on already provisioned TRIB-PTP or Line-PTP/SCG-PTP, and if the RemValidSignalTimer is active (decrementing), the value of
RemValidSignalTimer shall be set to the new value of ValidSignalTimeinterval immediately.

5.2. 5.2. Fault Management and State Model
[| GRD-476 - Getting issue details... cr ,~tyg | | Transition into in-service state upon expiry of VS Timer

When the AINS feature is enabled on a TRIB-PTP or Line-PTP/SCG-PTP, the NE shall monitor for the presence of a valid signal on the TRIB-PTP and
the corresponding Client CTP, or Line-PTP/SCG-PTP and the corresponding Line CTP for the entire duration of Valid Signal Timer before transitioning
to an in-service state. Depending on the occurrence or absence of a fault before or after timer expires, the following cases shall be supported according
to the following state diagram:

* Upon expiry of the Valid Signal Timer, if there were no faults detected either on the TRIB-PTP or the corresponding Client CTP, Line-PTP/SCG-
PTP or the corresponding Line CTP for the entire duration of the timer, the TRIB-PTP and the Client CTP, or the Line-PTP/SCG-PTP and the Line
CTP shall transition to an “In-Service” state with AINS value set to disabled.

© Ifthe fault condition(s) occurs on the TRIB-PTP or Client CTP, the Line-PTP/SCG-PTP or Line CTP before the Valid Signal Timer expires, the
TRIB-PTP and the corresponding Client CTP, or the Line-PTP/SCG-PTP and the corresponding Line CTP shall transition to “Out-of-Service” state
(operational state=disabled) with AINS value set to enabled.

The presence of “fault” conditions or “abnormal” conditions or “invalid signal” is defined as the presence of an alarm which causes a Facility Failure (FAF)
state for the termination point. The FAF state (NE operational state qualifier=Faulted) is an out-of-service state.

The following requirements shall be used for triggering the FAF on TRIB-PTP, Line-PTP/SCG-PTP, Client CTPs, and SCH CTP that results in transition
into AINS or out of AINS state.
