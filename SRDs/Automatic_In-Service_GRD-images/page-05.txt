The following are the considerations of this feature for providing the best user experience to our customers.
1. The purpose of AINS for turning up client services in an “alarm-free state” must be delivered with high quality.
2. The fault management (Alarm reporting) sub-system has to be robust with predictable, reliable and consistent behavior.

3. A system which is built with a solid fault management solution/otfering becomes a key component for retaining the value proposition as an
incumbent equipment provider.

5. 5. AINS Requirements

5.1. 5.1. Configuration Management

[| GRD-459 - Getting issue details... St ,tys | ] AINS Support on TRIB interface

The Infinera NE shall support the Automatic In-Service (AINS) provisioning feature on the TRIB-PTP of all the circuit pack types which has a tributary
interface to the client equipment. Furthermore, the AINS feature shall be supported for both the pre-provisioning and auto-provisioning cases.

[ GRD-460 - Getting issue details... St,~tys _] AINS Support on Line/SCG interface

The Infinera NE shall support the Automatic In-Service (AINS) provisioning feature on the Line-PTP/SCG-PTP of all the circuit pack types which has a
line interface to the network. Furthermore, the AINS feature shall be supported for both the pre-provisioning and auto-provisioning cases.

The TRIB-PTP and Line-/SCG-PTP are specifically selected as the choice of termination points to support AINS feature because during test and turn-up
(or troubleshooting) of the client and line signals coming into Infinera network node, the TRIB-PTPs and Line-/SCG-PTPs act as the edge points of the
network and client boundary. It is to be noted that when the AINS feature is applied to the TRIB-PTP, the corresponding client shall also be placed either in
the AINS state or in an alarm suppression state.

NOTE: The AINS feature can also be applied to other termination points (OTS, OCG etc.) and equipment types which is not required immediately and can

be supported in the future. If and when this is needed, this GRD will be updated to include the definitions of abnormal conditions on these equipment and
termination points.

[ GRD-461 - Getting issue details... Statys _] AINS configuration

The NE shall allow the configuration of AINS state on the TRIB-PTP and Line-PTP/SCG-PTP using the attribute “AINS" as defined in the information
model table.

[| GRD-462 - Getting issue details... cratyg _] AINS default template support

The NE shall allow the management interfaces to provision the AINS configuration specified in GRD-459 and GRD-460 using the default template
mechanism that is provided on a per NE basis. Changes to the AINS configuration using the default template shall be allowed all the time without any
preconditions. Furthermore, the changes made to the AINS configuration in the default template will take effect on the TRIB-PTPs and Line-PTP/SCG-
PTPs that are created subsequently after the change is made to the default template.

NOTE: Changing the AINS configuration on an already provisioned TRIB-PTPs and Line-/SCG-PTPs shall follow the rules as specified in GRD-469.
[| GRD-463 - Getting issue detalls... | Sr ,tys | ] Overriding the AINS configuration in the default template configuration

In addition to supporting the configuration through the default template, the NE shall allow the configuration of AINS on a per TRIB-PTP and per Line-
PTP/SCG-PTP basis.

This requirement is used to cover the following two use cases:
1. When the AINS template value is set to disabled and the user wants to provision a particular TRIB or Line/SCG port using the AINS state.
2. When the AINS template value is set to enabled, the TRIB or Line/SCG port was earlier brought into service. However, there is a recurring fault
on the TRIB/Client or Line/SCG port on which the user wants to apply the AINS feature.

NOTE: The AINS feature shall not be limited to just during test and turn-up but can be applied any time on the TRIB or Line/SCG interfaces.

[| GRD-464 - Getting issue details... sratyg | ] Configuration of Valid Signal Timer Value

The NE shall allow the configuration of AINS Valid Signal Timer value on the TRIB-PTP and Line-PTP/SCG-PTP using the attribute
“ValidSignalTimelnterval” as defined in the information model table. The standard value range-check shall also be supported.
