[| GRD-465 - Getting issue detalls.../ Gr ,zys | ] Default template support for Valid Signal Timer configuration

The NE shall allow the configuration of ValidSignalTimeinterval specified in GRD-464 using the default template mechanism that is provided on a per
NE basis. Changes to the ValidSignalTimeinterval configuration using the default template shall be allowed at all times without any pre-conditions.
Further, the changes made to the ValidSignalTimelnterval configuration in the default template will take effect on the TRIB-PTPs and Line-PTP/SCG-
PTPs that are created subsequently after the change is made to the default template.

[| GRD-466 - Getting issue details... Gratyg | |] Overtiding the Valid Signal Timer value configuration in the default template
configuration

In addition to supporting the configuration through the default template, the NE shall allow the configuration of ValidSignalTimelnterval specified in GRD-
464 on a per TRIB-PTP and per Line-PTP/SCG-PTP basis.

[| GRD-467 - Getting issue detalls...” cr,tyg | ] Retrieval of the Remaining Valid Signal Timer Value

The NE shall support the retrieval of the Time Remaining for the configured valid signal timer to expire. The attribute “RemValidSignalTimer” as defined
in the information model table shall be used.

In order to get the time remaining for the valid signal timer, the user shall explicitly execute a retrieval operation from the NE, through the management
interface. There will not be any autonomous notifications (AVCs) sent by the NE for the remaining valid signal timer value.

[| GRD-468 - Getting issue details...’ St,tyg _] Format of Remaining Valid Signal Timer Value

The management interfaces shall support a user-friendly interface for the configuration and display of the timer values in the following format.
* DD-HH-MM
DD: Number of days. Values are from 00 to 05 days.
HH: Number of hours. Values are from 00 to 23.
‘MM: Number of minutes. Values are from 00 to 59.

Note: The maximum value of the timer shall be 5 days.

[| GRD-469 - Getting issue detalls.../ Gr ,tys | ] No pre-condition for changing AINS configuration between Disabled and Enabled

When performing AINS configuration on an already provisioned TRIB-PTP or Line-PTP/SCG-PTP, the NE shall allow changing the AINS configuration tr
eely between Disabled and Enabled at any time irrespective of the state of TRIB-PTP or Line-PTP/SCG-PTP or the value of RemValidSignalTimer.

Note: This allows users to disable or enable AINS regardless of fault conditions or states. Enabling AINS without a fault still takes the entity out of
service, but the supported entities stay in service.

Please note that throughout this document, a Client CTP refers to all the Client CTPs listed in GRD-477, depending on the applicability and deployment
scenario. The above requirement is used to cover the case where the user wants to disable the AINS feature and start monitoring the faults again.

[| GRD-470 - Getting issue detalls.... Sr ,tys | ] Allow AdminState Lock and Maintenance when AINS is enabled

The NE shall allow a TRIB-PTP or Line-PTP/SCG-PTP which is in AINS state to be configured to the Locked or Maintenance state.

[| GRD-471 - Getting issue detalls.... Gr ,tyg | ] No impact to existing AINS configuration when default template is updated

The NE shall ensure that changing the AINS configuration in the default template shall not cause the change in value of AINS on an already provisioned
TRIB-PTP or Line-PTP/SCG-PTP.

[| GRD-472 - Getting issue detalls... | Sr ,tys | ] No impact to default template when TRIB/Line/SCG AINS is updated

The NE shall ensure that changing the AINS configuration on an individual TRIB-PTP or Line-PTP/SCG-PTP shall not cause the value in the default
template to be changed.

[| GRD-473 - Getting issue details... ¢r,tyg | |] No impact to existing AINS Valid Signal Time Interval configuration when default
template is updated

The NE shall ensure that changing the ValidSignalTimeinterval in the default template shall not cause the change in value of ValidSignalTimelnterval
already provisioned on the TRIB-PTP or Line-PTP/SCG-PTP.
