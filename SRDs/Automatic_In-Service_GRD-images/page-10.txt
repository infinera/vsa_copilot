[| GRD-484 - Getting issue details... Gt,tys | ] Controller Card reset or active switch

Itis desirable that a node controller card reboot or switch-over shall not trigger the reset of RemValidSignalTimer value to the configured value for
ValidSignalTimelnterval.

The above objective is desirable to cover the case of not restarting AINS feature all over again when the controller resets or a controller activity switch
takes place.

[| GRD-485 - Getting issue detalls.../ St ,tyg | ] Control Plane Failure when VS Timer is active

During the time RemValidSignalTimer is active (decrementing) and the control plane connectivity between the tributary module hosting the TOM or the
line module, and controller module is down, then it is acceptable that the RemValidSignalTimer continues to decrement, and the state transitions are
carried accordingly.

[| GRD-486 - Getting issue detalls.... cr ,zyg | ] Control Plane failure when fault is outstanding

When AINS is enabled on the TRIB-PTP or Line-PTP/SCG-PTP with any of the outstanding fault specified in GRD-477 and GRD-478, and a control
plane failure is also present between the tributary module hosting the TOM or the line module and controller module, then it is acceptable that the AINS
state is held until the control plane is recovered and the fault conditions are re-evaluated accordingly. The following cases shall be handled.

1. When the control plane is recovered and there is no fault present as specified in GRD-477 and GRD-478, then the RemValidSignalTimer starts
decrementing from the configured value for ValidSignalTimeinterval.

2. When the control plane is recovered and there is any fault present as specified in GRD-477 and GRD-478, then the RemValidSignalTimer is reset
to the configured value for ValidSignalTimeinterval. No count-down of RemValidSignalTimer occurs in this scenario as there is still a fault present.

[ GRD-487 - Getting issue details... sr,tyg | ] Path level failures - CTP

It is acceptable that the NE do not mask the path level faults (e.g. DTP in DTN and ODU in XTN) when the TRIB-PTP or Line-PTP/SCG-PTP is in the
AINS enabled state.

Itis expected that the Infinera network-side faults are useful to be reported to isolate the failure inside the Infinera network. The AINS feature is used only
at the edge point where the tributary/client signals and line signals are monitored for faults during turn up or troubleshooting. Note that the ODU-level CSF
is considered a client signal failure and is included in the AINS hierarchy.

[| GRD-488 - Getting issue detalls... | cr ,tyg | ] SNC Alarm masking resulting from TRIB/Client or Line/SCG Failures

The NE shall mask the SNC failure alarm which results from the faults specified in GRD-477 and GRD-478, and the corresponding TRIB-PTP or Line-
PTP/SCG-PTP on which SNC is created is in the AINS enabled state.

There are no separate timers provided for SNCs or Client Termination Points. The timers (both RemValidSignalTimer and ValidSignalTimelnterval) are
provided only on the TRIB-PTP and Line-PTP/SCG-PTP. If the user wants to check how much time is remaining before SNC or a client termination point
transition to In-Service state, he/she shall explicitly perform a retrieval operation on the corresponding TRIB-PTP or Line-PTP/SCG-PTP managed object
where SNC or Client Termination Point resides.

Interaction between Trib-PTP AINS, SNC and Client-CTP states

The following state transition diagram illustrates state transitions that are supported for the AINS states between the Trib-PTP, SNC and Client CTP.
