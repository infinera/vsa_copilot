STATUS | ] SNC alarms resulting from Path level faults

It is acceptable that the SNC failure alarm be reported at all times (irrespective of corresponding TRIB or Line/SCG being in AINS enabled or disabled
mode) when there is a path (DTP/ODU) level fault present in any of the path points of the SNC.

The SNC failure alarms resulting from the DTP/ODU-level faults will be useful for debugging the problem in the Infinera network. Note that the only
exception to the above requirement is ODU-level CSF failure, which is considered as a client failure and is include in the AINS Facility Failure Condition,
thus masking the SNC fail alarm.
