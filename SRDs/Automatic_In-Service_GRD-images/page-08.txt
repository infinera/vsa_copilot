[| GRD-477 - Getting issue details... | Gr ,tys | ] Facility Failures - Invalid Signal Failures for the TRIB AINS feature

The NE shall use the service-atfecting alarms that contribute to the TRIB-PTP and the Client CTP facilities, and the supporting equipment for declaring
the signal as “invalid signal”.

For example (may not be a complete list of service-affecting alarms applicable to each facility):

* TRIB-PTP: OLOS, CDR-LOL
* Client CTPs:
SONET Client-CTP: ingress/egress LOF, ingress/egress AIS-L
SDH Client-CTP: ingress/egress LOF, ingress/egress MS-AIS
GbE Client-CTP: ingress/egress LOSYNC, ingress/egress LF, ingress/egress RF, ingress/egress HIBER, ingress LOA, ingress LOLM
OTU Client-CTP: ingress/egress LOF, ingress LOM, ingress LOL
ODU Client-CTP (service-mode=network-wrapper): egress CSF, egress AIS, egress OCI, egress LCK, PLM, TIM
= Note: As an exception, UCM4 in service-mode=switching considers the specified ODU Client-CTP alarms as invalid signals for AINS.
FC Client-CTP: ingress/egress LOSYNC, ingress/egress HIBER, ingress/egress LF, ingress/egress RF, ingress LOS, ingress LFA (FEC
enabled)
* Equipment (TOM or its supporting equipment; OTM, TIM, LM, TAM, etc.): EQPTFAIL, IMPROPRMVL, EQPTCOMFAIL, PWR-CLASS-
UNSUPPORTED

[| GRD-478 - Getting issue detalls.../ Sr ,tyg | ] Facility Failures - Invalid Signal Failures for the Line/SCG AINS feature

The NE shall use the following failure conditions that contribute to the Line-PTP/SCG-PTP and the SCH CTP facilities for declaring the signal as “invalid
signal”.

* Line-PTP/SCG-PTP: OLOS
* Line CTPs:
SCH-CTP: ALL-CARRIER-FAIL
Carrier-CTP (CHM7): COH-LOL, POST-FEC-Q-SIGNAL-FAILURE
* Equipment (line transceiver equipment or its supporting equipment): EQPTFAIL, IMPROPRMVL

[| GRD-479 - Getting issue detalls.... cr ,tyg | ] Alarm Masking when in AINS enabled state

When the AINS feature is enabled on the TRIB-PTP or Line-PTP/SCG-PTP, any alarms occurring on the TRIB-PTP and its corresponding Client CTP,
the Line-PTP/SCG-PTP and its corresponding SCH CTP, and the SNC (if present) shall not be reported to the management interfaces.

Note 1: Threshold Crossing Alerts (TCA) are not suppressed or inhibited when AINS is enabled in the GX line of products.

Note 2: Alarms that are managed in the controller card but dependent on the transport card, such as COMM-CHNL-DOWN, are not suppressed or
inhibited when AINS is enabled in the GX line of products.

When the AINS is enabled and the AINS remaining valid signal timer is decrementing, the data plane traffic is up and running. Only the alarm reporting is

turned off during AINS state.

State Transitions for the Trib-PTP AINS feature
