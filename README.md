# vsa_copilot

Lightweight repository for VSA Copilot users: contains role-specific system prompts and workspace snippets to quickly onboard VSA/VTA/VAE/VTE agents.

Structure
- `prompts/` — system prompts for each role (`vsa_prompt.md`, `vta_prompt.md`, `vae_prompt.md`, `vte_prompt.md`).
- `snippets/` — copy-ready VS Code snippets for common prompts and templates.
- `manifest.json` — simple manifest describing entries and usage.

Usage
1. Copy needed prompt text into Copilot Labs system prompt field.
2. Import snippets into VS Code user or workspace snippets.

Contributions
- Keep prompts concise and include grounding references where applicable.
